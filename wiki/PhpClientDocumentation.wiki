== Installing ==
To install, [http://code.google.com/p/clusttruck-api/downloads/list download] the lastest version and add it to your PHP source code.

== Using == 
To use the client, first include the client file:
{{{
include("path/to/the/ClusterTruck.php");
}}}

Next instantiate the ClusterTruck class:
{{{
$ct = new ClusterTruck("<API_KEY>","<API_SECRET>");
}}}

Then start making calls to the API:
{{{
$trucks = $ct->get_trucks();
}}}

=== Requests === 
To make API calls, use the following syntax with the ClusterTruck class:
{{{
 $ct->{http_method}_{method}({path},{query})
}}}

   * *http_method* HTTP request method _ex: GET_
   * *method* API Method _ex: trucks_
   * *path* API request path (optional)
   * *query* Hash of query parameters (optional)
 
=== Response ===
After making calls, you'll get back a ClusterTruckResponse object. To retrieve data from the object, request the root node name of the API response. So if I've requested a list of trucks, the root node is "trucks". To get the response:
{{{
 $trucks = $ct->get_trucks()->trucks;
}}}

For list calls (like trucks, locations, etc) you can also get the total and pages attributes:
{{{
 $trucks = $ct->get_trucks();
 $trucks->pages; // total number of list pages (total/per)
 $trucks->total; // total number of items in the list
}}}
